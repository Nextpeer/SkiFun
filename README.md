# SkiFun

This is a libGDX port of the popular 1991 PC game [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skifree) by [Chris Pirih](http://ski.ihoc.net/) with real-time multiplayer game with [Nextpeer](https://www.nextpeer.com/).

[**Play this right now if you want to**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextpeer.demos.skifun) (Google's Play Store).

## Trying it out

1. Pull SkiFun from GitHub:

	`git clone --recursive git@github.com:Nextpeer/SkiFun.git`
2. Import the Java projects to your Eclipse workspace (or alternatively [import the projects](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/migrate.html) to Android Studio).
3. Feel free to contact us on any question. [support@nextpeer.com](mailto:support@nextpeer.com).

## Features so far:

* Skiing down a never-ending skislope with randomly-generated trees and rocks.
* Collision detection with obstacles - and the appropriate reaction
* Turning left and right
* Distance tracking so you can see how far you've gone you absolute badass
* Speed boost (this was a little-known feature to get away from monsters) by tapping on the screen
* Platforms & jumping = fun
* And...Real time multiplayer. Play against your buddies and random people from all over the world!

## So, what's left to do?

* The evil monster
* Being a snowboarder instead of a boring old skier
* Tricks, or something?

Thanks!
